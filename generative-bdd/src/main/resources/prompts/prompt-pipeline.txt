Various parts of a Java class represented in a JSON format with attributes as className, importStatements, classBody and mavenDependencies
to read, transform and write Java objects described by the JSON ${input-data-entity}
to Java objects described by JSON ${output-data-entity}
as per the example scenario delimited by triple backticks.
```${scenario-text}```
wiring the following sample methods together to achieve the desired result
- for reading the input data ${reader}
- for transformation ${transformation}
- for writing the output records ${writer}
and using following assumptions
- using Java 8 features
- classBody should be represented as a single line
- maven dependency (if any) should be in format groupId:artifactId:version
- model entities already exist
- lombok builder pattern to be used to construct model entities
- has a main method that wires the read, transform and write methods
will be as follows:
